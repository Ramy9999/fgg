Welcome to the Custom Covid19 Chest Image Classifier Detector 

Description: The project was built in PyCharm and uses the python programming language, and the project is a deep learning Chest Image Classifier that uses tensorflow and other libraries to detect whether a person has Covid19 or not in those chest images.

To run the project:

1- Download or Clone the Github Repository

2- Install the dependancies and project requirements and libraries in the requirements.txt file by: pip install -r requirements.txt

3- Run in the terminal python app.py or application.py or main.py (whatever the python file is called), or alternatively run the app.py or the other names of the python file in your python supported IDE (preferrably PyCharm)

4- In the terminal output after some time and the project is built, you will have the local host link: http://127.0.0.1:5000/; click on it to open the web app in the browser

Note: the python deep learning app will take a bit of time (because it is large) to give you the localhost link where you will see the web app in action.

Or you can go to this link: https://fgg-7oqlzrgw7q-uc.a.run.app/

And that is it, you can play and test the code.
